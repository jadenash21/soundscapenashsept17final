For this soundscape, I am introducing listeners to a narrative commonly found on in hospital settings: a woman giving birth. In this narration, I use a combination of recorded sounds and sounds that I downloaded from freesound.com. My goal is to make listeners go through the emotions that they would experience as if they were attending a birth with someone. I want to experience the anxiety a person going into labor within a busy emergency room setting. I want them to feel nervous when the baby's heart declines. Finally, I want them to feel the joy of the mom and baby being safe together after a stressful birth. The entire experience should be cathartic at the end. Enjoy.
